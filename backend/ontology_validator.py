        Your task is to evaluate whether the ANSWER correctly aligns with the ONTOLOGY provided below.

        Return ONLY a JSON response in the format:
        {{
        "validation_result": "Pass" or "Not Pass",
        "confidence_score": CONFIDENCE_SCORE_HERE (between 0 and 1),
        "reasoning": "A brief explanation of why the answer is valid or not."
        }}

        DO NOT include anything outside of this JSON structure.

        Here are a few examples:

        ---
        Example 1 (Cybersecurity - Valid Answer, High Confidence):
        QUESTION: What is a vulnerability in cybersecurity?
        ANSWER: A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker.
        EXPECTED VALIDATION RESPONSE:
        {{
        "validation_result": "Pass",
        "confidence_score": 0.95,
        "reasoning": "Answer maps to 'system, can_expose, vulnerability' and 'attacker, can_exploit, vulnerability'."
        }}

        ---
        Example 2 (Cloud Computing - Valid Answer, High Confidence):
        QUESTION: What is virtualization in cloud computing?
        ANSWER: Virtualization is a technique that allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical system.
        EXPECTED VALIDATION RESPONSE:
        {{
        "validation_result": "Pass",
        "confidence_score": 0.92,
        "reasoning": "Answer maps to 'Concept/technique = Virtualization' in cloud computing ontology."
        }}

        ---
        Example 3 (Cybersecurity - Valid Answer, Medium-High Confidence):
        QUESTION: What tool can be used to analyze vulnerabilities?
        ANSWER: A logging tool.
        EXPECTED VALIDATION RESPONSE:
        {{
        "validation_result": "Pass",
        "confidence_score": 0.68,
        "reasoning": "Although brief, the answer is grounded in concepts like 'tool' and 'can_analyze vulnerability'."
        }}

        ---
        Example 4 (Cloud Computing - Valid Answer, Medium-High Confidence):
        QUESTION: What techniques are used for load distribution in cloud computing?
        ANSWER: Load balancing and auto-scaling are common techniques.
        EXPECTED VALIDATION RESPONSE:
        {{
        "validation_result": "Pass",
        "confidence_score": 0.7,
        "reasoning": "Answer correctly reflects cloud computing techniques from the ontology."
        }}

        ---
        Example 5 (Cybersecurity - Vague Answer, Low Confidence):
        QUESTION: What are security techniques in cybersecurity?
        ANSWER: Techniques are used to protect systems.
        EXPECTED VALIDATION RESPONSE:
        {{
        "validation_result": "Not Pass",
        "confidence_score": 0.4,
        "reasoning": "Answer is too vague and not grounded in specific ontology concepts like 'Risk Assessment' or 'HoneyPot'."
        }}

        ---
        Example 6 (Cloud Computing - Vague Answer, Low Confidence):
        QUESTION: What are characteristics of cloud computing?
        ANSWER: Cloud computing has many features.
        EXPECTED VALIDATION RESPONSE:
        {{
        "validation_result": "Not Pass",
        "confidence_score": 0.35,
        "reasoning": "Answer is too vague and does not mention ontology-grounded concepts like 'on-demand self-service' or 'resource pooling'."

        Example 7 (Neither - Irrelevant Answer, Zero Confidence):
        QUESTION: What is the capital of France?
        ANSWER: Paris is the capital of France.
        EXPECTED VALIDATION RESPONSE:
        {{
        "validation_result": "Not Pass",
        "confidence_score": 0.0,
        "reasoning": "Answer is factually correct but completely unrelated to cybersecurity or cloud computing ontology."
